How to play the game:

The game supports 2-7 players. You first add players using the add player button. When you type the player's name in
the textField, click enter and the player is added to the game. 

Click start game and the hand is automatically loaded for you. It will be the first player's view (the player whose view
it is will be highlighted in yellow in the players list). Click a tile and drag it on the board where you want it to be 
placed. If you wish to place it back into your hand, simply drag it back to the hand from the board.

There is an Estore button on the right. Click it and you will be shown the EstorePanel. click any enchantment to buy it.
The price for an enchantment is 5 points. Click the Estore button again to close the Estore. Now on the right under
the Estore button are 3 other buttons (bankrupt, loseturns, takewords). The number next to these buttons corresponds
to how many of each enchantment you have. if you click on one of those buttons while you have that enchantment, you will select
that enchantment. Now, click on any tile on the board (that you are currently placing or that has been placed already)
to set the enchantment. (Note: if you click an enchantment button on your panel, you HAVE to play that enchantment on
a tile, there's no going back!). Now that tile will show up pink on your screen and your screen only until it is activated,
then it won't be pick to anyone anymore. (Note: you can play a word on that enchanted tile without activating the
enchantment on yourself).

If you have a blank tile, place it like any other tile, the game will ask what you want to set it as. Enter the letter
into the text box and press enter. If you want to drag it back to your hand, simply do so and it will turn blank again.

The rest is pretty self explanatory. The game ends once the bag is empty.
